# google_clone
A clone of the standard google search page as well as images and advanced search.

This was the first assignment for CS50W - Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. 

The goal was to mimic the google homepage's look and functionality, as well as the images and advanced search features. To do this, forms were created with specific queries for each input so that the appropiate actions would be taken when searching using the default search vs image search, for example. 

While I'm not as confident as I'd like to be with the ways I used CSS to align some of the elements on each page, I can certainly say that my understanding of both HTML and CSS has drastically improved just from this assignment alone. Big thanks to Bootstrap for simplifying a lot of the styling!
